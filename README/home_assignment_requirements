Take Home Assignment

Completing this assignment should demonstrate knowledge and effective application of various
test automation tools and techniques.

REST API Automation
URI: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
Note: This API has a free plan and it should be enough for test development and test execution,
but it still requires a sign up. For details see https://openweathermap.org/current .

Implement test scripts accomplishing the following:

Script 1:
- Query the URI by the city name
- Verify `name` attribute corresponds to the entered city name

Script 2:
- Query the URI by latitude and longitude
- Verify `coord.lat` and `coord.lon` attributes correspond to the ones entered

Script 3:
- Query the URI by ZIP code
- Verify `name` attribute corresponds to the city that contains the ZIP code (e.g. 10007
should correspond to NYC, 94040 should correspond to Mountain View, CA, etc.)


Notes:
